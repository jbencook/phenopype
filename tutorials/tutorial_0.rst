How to run the tutorials
========================

The tutorials are written as `Jupyter notebooks`, interactive web-apps to run, document, and visualize code: `https://jupyter.org/ <https://jupyter.org/>`_. If you installed Python using Anaconda, it is possible that :code:`jupyter` is already installed - check py typing :code:`jupyter --version` into the console. Otherwise you can install it with pip

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install jupyter notebook

After installing phenopype, download and unpack the phenopype repository from `github <https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype>`_. Go to the tutorial folder, open a terminal and run the notebooks:

.. code-block:: bash

	jupyter notebook

Alternatively, you can copy the code from the jupyter code cells over to Spyder and execute them there. In this case you need to adjust the file paths given in the code cells accordingly.
