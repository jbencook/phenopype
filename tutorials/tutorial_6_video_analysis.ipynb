    "# Tutorial 6: Video analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The principles of video analysis and image analysis are similar. The phenopype video tracking module performs image segmentation using single video frames. However, when working with animals, a big advantage to static images is the fact that they move so that the differences among imges can be used to train a background model from which the foreground can segmented. This is called foreground-background subtraction (https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d1/dc5/tutorial_background_subtraction.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the tracking module works standalone and uses only few routines of the phenopype core modules. Future releases may feature a better integration with the different phenopype workflows.  "

    "First, the `motion_tracker` class needs to be called on the video-path. This will initialize the procedure with basic information on the input video. Specifying video output is optional: the tracking procedure can be run without saving any record of the tracking-results, but only the results (i.e. just a csv with coordinates and no video). Should the `video_ouput` method be called then it will save an output video with similar properties (codec, dimensions, fps.) of the input file.    "
