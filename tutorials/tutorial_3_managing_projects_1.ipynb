    "A central aspect of efficiently using Phenopype is to work from within a `project`. Phenopype projects are composed of a directory tree in which each folder contains the copy or a link to a single raw image file (1). Alongside the images to be processed, users can store configuration file for the `pype` routine that we covered in the  [previous tutorial](tutorial_2_phenopype_workflow.ipynb): configurations files can be created using preconfigured templates, which can easily be modifed (2). Once raw images have been added and configuration files are in place, the `pype` routine is used until results are satisfactory (3). Together, the raw images, the `pype`-configuration files and the saved results files are all that is needed to completely reproduce any phenotypic data that was collected in the process (4). "
