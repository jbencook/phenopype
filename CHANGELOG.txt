Unreleased / planned
====================

tutorial:
- explicit vs. implicit in pype-config (e.g. mask labels)


shortterm:
- update readme (better looks for phenopype)
- fix tutorials, and make more (by function)
- add tutorial: tracking
- add testing: tracking, landmark, mask 

midterm:
- change rectangle method for mask_maker
- internalize zoom method (with canvas) to show_img or interact_img
- make ret options for methods
- declutter modules / remove self. references

longterm:
- internal: decluttering of base module / outhousing of classes and methods 
- watershed algorithms
- implement gapless zooming as a choice
- project management globally acessible through base functions
- object_finder returns histogram of length, area and grayscale of all objects
- a quick-thresholding method in marked area for single images 

Known bugs
==========
- object_finder: resizing of image not resizing masks (try to build a size-matcher)
- high GUI / windows sometimes crash. Stop Kernel and use "cv2.destroyAllWindows()"



0.10.0
------
bugfix:
- add_files with multiple ex- or include argument created duplicated filelists


0.9.0
------
- New feature: scale (former scale_maker) can now automatically equalize histograms via interpolation. Was mostly inspired by this SO question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32655686/histogram-matching-of-two-images-in-python-2-x
- renamed "scale_maker" method to "scale", and subfunctions, too. tutorials updated. more name changes to come towards a more intuitive naming convention
- show_img can now show multiple images when list is provided
- 

0.8.0
------
- scale_maker is completely reworked: now has zoom and onscreen notifications for mm/pixel info. measuring scale and making a template for detection are now two separate functions (measure_scale and make_scale_template)
- documentation and API reference for tracking module added 
- test for scale added

0.7.2
------
- landmark_maker has now (limited) mousewheel zooming functionality
- changed instructions for phenopype installation: make virtual env in conda for better package control (e.g. avoid different opencv versions)

0.7.1
------
bugfix:
- "filename not found" when no objects were found

0.7.0
------
- full landmark functionality added (refer to "landmark_maker" readme in the docs)
- additionally: measure length of curvy specimens from within the landmarking function ("arc")
- generic image registration (aka feature recognition) added, will be properly introduced and documented in the next version 


0.6.1
------
- "scale_maker" can return now has attribute "mask_obj" to pass on to "object_finder" (tuple of 3)
bugfix:
- missing "filetypes" argument in "project_finder" help
- default value for "factor in "scale.detect"


0.6.0
------
- integration with opencv-contrib-python==3.4.5.20
- tracking functionality added, integration with trackpy
- testing environment in place, integration with pytest
- initialize classes directly with image
- tutorials included for basic python (1) and object finding (2)
Known bugs:
- base "fillyPoly" sometimes breaks - culprit numpy datatype?
- base.polygon_maker "include=False" excludes everything


0.5.1
------
- functions take numpy array in addition to string with path to image
- bugfix: opencv-contrib-python version 3.* 


0.5.0
------
- object_finder functions streamlined and "skeletonize" algorithm added
- better documentation with docstrings 
- docstring integration with sphinx 
- __init__ rework for sphinx integration


0.4.11
------
- first release to pypi
