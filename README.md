phenopype is currently in alpha, and still under heavy construction. Core features like object detection or videotracking work, but are tailored to specific contexts and organisms. To see what phenopype can already do, go to the feature section. To see what phenopype will be able to do soon (or at some point), go to the development section. 

phenopype is developed by [me](www.luerig.net) by applying its features to  for specific
