Installation
=============

1. Install Python 
------------------

To get started, download and install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ 
with Python 3. Anaconda is a scientific python distribution which comes with the most common 
scientific Python packages already built in.

You can test if the installation was successfull by opening a terminal and typing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda --version

If :code:`conda` is not recognized, use the anaconda prompt (e.g. through the `Anaconda Navigator 
<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/>`_ OR add the path to your Anaconda 
installation directory (e.g. :code:`C:\Anaconda3\Library\bin`) to your environmental variables. Further
help can be found `here <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/>`_, `here <https://askubuntu.com/questions/908827/variable-path-issue-conda-command-not-found>`_, `here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44597662/conda-command-is-not-recognized-on-windows-10>`_, and `here <https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-successfully-install-anaconda-on-a-mac-and-actually-get-it-to-work-53ce18025f97>`_.


2. Install phenopype
-----------------------

First, use :code:`conda` create a virtual environment to have fuller control over your python packages. If you 
prefer an "Rstudio-like" feel, install the Spyder IDE (Integrated Development Environment). An slightly outdated 
overview of other popular Python IDEs can be found `here <https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments>`_. 
However, phenopype can of course also be run from the command line using :code:`python`.

.. code-block:: bash

	conda create -n "pp" python=3.7
	conda install spyder

.. important::

	Any modifications to the python environments or `Spyder`, should only be done using :code:`conda`. 

Then activate the virtual environment and install phenopype using `pip` in your terminal or command line:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda activate pp
	pip install phenopype

To install the latest development version of `phenopype`, which can be found on 
`github <https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype/tree/development>`_, create a different environment 
and install `phenopype` with :code:`git`:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda create -n "pp_dev" python=3.7 spyder
	conda activate pp_dev
	pip install git
	pip install git+https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype@development


Run phenopype by typing :code:`spyder` or :code:`python` into the command line. If you are unsure to proceed, consult the tutorials.


.. important::

	Any modifications to `phenopype`, its dependencies or other python packages should only be done using :code:`pip`.
