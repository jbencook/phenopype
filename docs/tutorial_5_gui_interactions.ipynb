    "# Tutorial 5: GUI interactions (masks, lines and drawing tools)\n",

    "Phenopype uses OpenCV's [High GUI module](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html) to display images and to allow users to interact with images. High GUI has a few pros and cons: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "+ native OpenCV GUI (no extra GUI libraries required)\n",
    "+ the module is extremely fast in displaying images \n",
    "+ it can display very large image-arrays (> 10000x10000 pixels)\n",
    "+ it can display multiple images side by side\n",
    "+ interactions (drawing and measuring) are possible \n",
    "\n",
    "- sometimes unstable (e.g. windows are not closed but freeze)\n",
    "- issues with cross plattform stability (e.g. on macOS)\n",
    "- displaying instructions is hacky (text is \"painted\" onto a displayed image) \n",
    "- user input (key strokes and mouse clicks) sometimes isn't captured properly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently Phenopype uses the standard GUI libraries that ship with the most recent precompiled `opencv-contrib-python` that are listed on the [Python package index](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), which is `Qt` for Linux and macOS, and `Win32 UI` on Windows. The `Qt` GUI is a bit more userfriendly with builtin buttons, scrollbars, RGB info and zoom ([see the OpenCV docs](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/d46/group__highgui__qt.html)), but you don't actually need those things for Phenopype GUI interactions.
